Players are given a rather critic letter talking about finding out the truth and if they want to know then they should meet at a certain place near the outer wall at a certain time.
There a deathwatch soldier walks up to them and demands to see their papers. (Normally these would be the papers they'd need to go though the gates into the wastes). The soldier will say the other papers even if they have a licence to go outside.
They mean the letter. On being shown the letter, the soldier gives them a piece of paper with holes cut in it.
This reveils a location outside of the wall to meet.
Well probably instructions on how to get to the meeting place.
Anyway they find a shack out in the middle of nowhere where an old man waits for them.
He tells them about the day Newcastle fell and how he was there and how so many of his men lost their lives trying to hold off the zombie hords, how they continued to hold it till the last man because the Prince himself was there. How he'd got trapped under some rubble and managed to survive. Whilst he was spared death at the teeth of a zombie, instead he managed to catch the blight. After being picked up by some undertakers who were taking advantage of the battle to pick up some easy bounties he had returned to London and being give a discharge. He also began hearing rumours about how the Prince not only died in Newcastle but it turned out he was a vampire and the search was on to find his ashes. Slowly dying from the blight, with his last few months of live wants to find out if his men died for a human or wasted their life's defending a vampire.

He will give the players a dangorus mission to prove their loyalty and to try and flush out any royal or government spies(rob a bank or something of that nature)
